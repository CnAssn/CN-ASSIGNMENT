instructions to run the program: 
   - first MyServer is excecuted and then MyClient

Format of command line args:

./sender <Window size> <Seqnum> <N> <receiver IP> <receiver port> 
 example -  java MyClient 4 4 4 localhost 12345
   
./receiver <Seq> <I> <receiver port>
 example -  java MyServer 4 3 12345
 


Working: MyClient
                - getMd5 function is used to calculate checksum
                - sockect is established b/w client and server
                - packect is sent adding checksum
                - receiver sends ack if packect is received in order
                    else last recevied pack inorder ack is sent
                - sender resends if pack is received out of order

          MyServer
                 - Sockect connection is established and recevies pack from client
                 - every ith packect is rejected 
                 - if packect is received as expected in order then send right ack
                       else ack of last received in order is sent

concepts learnt: GBN working, window sliding protocols
                 difference between tcp and udp sockets

we request you to kindly give us more time to elobrataley study the concepts and
 later apply them to assignments
